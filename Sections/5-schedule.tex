\label{ch-schedule}

My proposed timeline for the remainder of my PhD, included is three additional publications (1) conference proceeding (2025 M\&C) about MC/DC's GPU performance, (2) journal article about deterministic work currently completed, and (3) journal article about investigated acceleration schemes.
