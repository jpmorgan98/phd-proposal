\section{Submitted Draft: Performant and Portable\\ Monte Carlo Neutron Transport via Numba}
\label{app:cise}

This paper was submitted to \textit{IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering} on September 3rd 2024. 
I have not received a response.
A preprint was posted to arxiv and has been the assigned the DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2409.04668.

My coauthors are all members of the Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport (CEMeNT) includes
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ilham Variansyah, PhD (committee member)
    \item Braxton Cuneo, PhD
    \item Todd S. Palmer, PhD (committee member)
    \item Kyle E. Niemeyer, PhD (advisor)
\end{itemize}
As MC/DC is the primary deliverable of CEMeNT it is a deeply combative effort.
