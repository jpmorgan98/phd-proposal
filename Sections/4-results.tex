\section{Deterministic transport}

\subsection{Fourier Anylisys of Discretization Scheme}
We found that the MB-SCB scheme is unconditionally stable over $\mu \in [-1, 1]$. While experimenting with this method we did find that, under some conditions, it can produce negative fluxes; however, the negative flux oscillations were critically damped and dissipated with time.
